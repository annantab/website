            My Recipe Book
        </h1>
        <p class = "description">This book is a collection of all the recipes that I have cooked during winter break starting December 16th 2023 to January 6th 2024. So far most of my meals have been mainly carbohydrates such as pastas, noodles, and rice. It tastes good but I don't feel super satisfied with the meals so I want to try and make some more fiberous or keto styles meals. I plan to record them all on this website. I'm also trying to learn web dev so I'm using this website to play around had get better at web dev. I just learned about box models and some of the frequent element tags in html and also how to style them in css. I don't know much about other components that I can make. My goal for this website is to make it super easy to make recipes at home if you are a beginner chef. I want to be able to type in what ingredients I have in the fridge and be able to make a dish out of it. </p>
